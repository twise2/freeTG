# freeTG (new world? Nexus?)

An open source card game and site built around providing world builders the ability to submit short stories that can then be used to pull events/characters out of that story into the game world.

TODO:
Create basic rules sheets and magic system (this will be a card only game to make printing nice and usable)

Create "world" rules for the how/what/why new world being created

Create crux for how things get pulled into the game world

Create site to easily submit and browse the short stories and highlight names/parts that want to be generated into cards 
  -Short story for the backstory
  -crux that makes them able to be pulled into the main world
  -What they are trying to do in the new world

Stories belong to the author and should link back to them in some way so they get credit for what they create. 

Create the ability for users to submit art for cards without it.

These can be made into "releases" for the game.
